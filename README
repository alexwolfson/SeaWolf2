===================

Summary:

This project is created to provide an open source appliation for
the different aspects of Apnea training.
Qt/QML 5.5+ is used as a developmet toolkit.
I used this app as a way to become proficient with QML/Qt development

Apnea:

Software Architecture:

To preserve configurations/results JSON is used so far (I might switch to YAML or Database later), but for start choice seems natural,
because of the Javascript nature of QML

For application configuration saved in JSON

{"name": string, "birthdate": date, "gender": ["M", "F"], "best": time}

For sessions configurations saving in JSON

{"session":"Name"
   [
      {"breath": seconds, "hold": seconds, "walk":seconds},
      {"breath": seconds, "hold": seconds, "walk":seconds},
      ...
   ]
}

For the result saving in JSON

{ "session": "Name", "date": data_time,
[
   {"breath: seconds, "heartrate":[number,number,...]},
   {"hold": seconds, "heartrate":[number,number,...]},
   {"walk": seconds, "steps": number, "heartrate":[number,number,...]}
   {"walkback": seconds, "heartrate":[number,number,...]}
]
}

Gauges have 2 states: "initial" and "stateRun"
